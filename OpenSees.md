# Introduction #

The Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation


# Details #

The Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) is a software framework for simulating the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems. OpenSees has been developed as the computational platform for research in performance-based earthquake engineering at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. OpenSees is also the simulation component for the NEESit since 2004.
Capabilities
OpenSees has advanced capabilities for modeling and analyzing the nonlinear response of systems using a wide range of material models, elements, and solution algorithms. The software is designed for parallel computing to allow scalable simulations on high-end computers or for parameter studies.
Modeling
OpenSees providing beam-column elements and continuum elements for structural and geotechnical models. A wide range of uniaxial materials and section models are available for beam-columns.
Analysis
Nonlinear analysis requires a wide range of algorithms and solution methods. OpenSees provides nonlinear static and dynamic methods, equation solvers, and methods for handling constraints.
Development Process
OpenSees is open-source. This website provides information about the software architecture, access to the source code, and the development process. The open-source movement allows earthquake engineering researchers and users to build upon each others accomplishments using OpenSees as community-based software.
